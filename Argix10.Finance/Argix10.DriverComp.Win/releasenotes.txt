INSTALLATION

DEPLOYMENT
DriverComp is installed into a Click-Once deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Argix10\Apps\Finance\DriverComp on a web server like rgxvmweb using 
	Windows explorer. 
2.	Create a sub-folder called Application Files.
3.	Copy the new versioned Click-Once deployment folder (i.e DriverComp_4_0_0_2) into the Application Files folder; this folder 
	contains the following:
		Argix10.Windows.Lib.dll
		DriverComp.application
		DriverComp.exe
		DriverComp.exe.config
		DriverComp.exe.manifest
		Infragistics2.Shared.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.UltraWinGrid.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.v12.1.dll
		Microsoft.ReportViewer.Common.dll
		Microsoft.ReportViewer.ProcessingObjectModel.dll
		Microsoft.ReportViewer.WinForms.dll
		releasenotes.txt
4.	Copy the deployment manifest, DriverComp.application, into the DriverComp folder. This manifest points to
	tha application manifest (i.e. \DriverComp_4_0_0_2\DriverComp.exe.manifest)
5.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.
6.	Verify http access from Internet Explorer to the following url: 
		http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/Finance/DriverComp/DriverComp.application
7.	The Click-Once deployment is installed on the client machine in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 folder.
8.	Version rollbacks are accomplished by simply copying the deployment manifest (i.e. DriverComp.application) from 
	a previous Click-Once deployment folder (i.e DriverComp_4_0_0_1) into the DriverComp root folder


CONFIGURATION	
Open the local sort database (i.e. TSORT on rgxvmsql), goto the Configuration table, and add/edit the 
values below. Individual users can have overrides from the default values.

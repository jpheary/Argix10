tariffName 					* Tariff name (8 characters)
shipmentDateCCYYMMDD 		* Shipment Date (CCYYMMDD). This field is used to select the desired tariff module for rating. If the actual shipment date is passed in this field, RateWareXL will select the appropriate tariff module in effect based on the shipment date and Tariff name passed. If the user wants to specify a specific tariff module for rating (regardless the of actual shipment date), passing the effective date of the tariff module will rate the shipment based on that effective date.

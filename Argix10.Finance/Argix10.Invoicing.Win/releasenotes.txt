INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
Invoicing is installed into a Click-Once deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Argix10\Apps\Finance\Invoicing on a web server like rgxvmweb using 
	Windows explorer. 
2.	Create a sub-folder called Application Files.
3.	Copy the new versioned Click-Once deployment folder (i.e Invoicing_4_0_0_2) into the Application Files folder; this folder 
	contains the following:
		Argix10.Export.Lib.dll
		Argix10.Windows.Lib.dll
		Invoicing.application
		Invoicing.exe
		Invoicing.exe.config
		Invoicing.exe.manifest
		Infragistics2.Shared.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.UltraWinGrid.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.v10.1.dll
		releasenotes.txt
4.	Copy the deployment manifest, Invoicing.application, into the Invoicing folder. This manifest points to
	tha application manifest (i.e. \Invoicing_4_0_0_2\Invoicing.exe.manifest)
5.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.
6.	Verify http access from Internet Explorer to the following url: 
		http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/Finance/Invoicing/Invoicing.application
7.	The Click-Once deployment is installed on the client machine in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 folder.
8.	Version rollbacks are accomplished by simply copying the deployment manifest (i.e. Invoicing.application) from 
	a previous Click-Once deployment folder (i.e Invoicing_4_0_0_1) into the Invoicing root folder


CONFIGURATION

NOTES
==============
GENERAL
The Invoicing Application (Invoicing.exe) is a Windows based application used to create an 
Excel file of an existing client or vendor invoice from the AS/400.


DEPENDENCIES
The Invoicing application is dependent upon the following web services: 
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Finance.Services/Invoicing.svc
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Membership.Services/RoleService.svc

OPERATION
The Invoicing Application (Invoicing.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment url 
(i.e. http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/Finance/Invoicing/Invoicing.application). After a brief splash screen, a 
sizeable window appears that allows selection of a client and shows a list of invoices for that client. Open 
an invoice selection and an Excel spreadshet is downloaded with the invoice data.
Additional operating steps can be found in the on-line documentation provided by the Help/Contents menu item.

ROLE MANAGEMENT

Billing Clerk- can create Excel invoices.

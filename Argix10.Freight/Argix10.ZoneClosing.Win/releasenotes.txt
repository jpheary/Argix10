INSTALLATION
==============
Zone Closing is installed into a Click-Once deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Argix10\Apps\Freight\ZoneClosing on a web server like rgxvmweb using 
	Windows explorer. 
2.	Create a sub-folder called Application Files. 
3.	Copy the new versioned Click-Once deployment folder (i.e ZoneClosing_4_0_0_2) into the Application Files folder; this folder 
	contains the following:
		Argix10.Windows.Lib.dll
		Infragistics4.Shared.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.UltraWinGrid.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.v12.1.dll
		releasenotes.txt
		ZoneClosing.application
		ZoneClosing.exe
		ZoneClosing.exe.config
		ZoneClosing.exe.manifest
4.	Copy the deployment manifest, ZoneClosing.application, into the ZoneClosing folder. This manifest points to
	tha application manifest (i.e. \ZoneClosing_4_0_0_2\ZoneClosing.exe.manifest)
5.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.
6.	Verify http access from Internet Explorer to the following url: 
		http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/Freight/ZoneClosing/ZoneClosing.application
7.	The Click-Once deployment is installed on the client machine in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 folder.
8.	Version rollbacks are accomplished by simply copying the deployment manifest (i.e. ZoneClosing.application) from 
	a previous Click-Once deployment folder (i.e ZoneClosing_4_0_0_1) into the ZoneClosing root folder

NOTES
==============
GENERAL
The Zone Closing Application (ZoneClosing.exe) is a Windows based application used to manage routing 
of sorted cartons (lane designations), organize groups of outbound freight into TL’s, and associate 
outbound freight with line-haul schedules at a local terminal. In addition, the application provides 
related reports.


DEPENDENCIES
The Dispatch application is dependent upon the following web services: 
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Freight.Services/TsortService.svc
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.AgentLineHaul.Services/ISDExportService.svc
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Membership.Services/RoleService.svc


ROLE MANAGEMENT
The following roles are used in this application:
Shipping Clerk
- can do everything.
Shipping Supervisor
- can do everything.

Use the following link to access the role manager to create and edit role assignments for Argix employees: 
http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/IT/Membership/Membership.application


OPERATION
Normal:
The Zone Closing Application (ZoneClosing.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment url 
(i.e. http://<server>/Argix10/Apps/Freight/ZoneClosing/ZoneClosing.application). After a brief splash screen, 
the application displays a list of open TLs. The taskbar displays the operating terminal and connection 
status. Additional operating steps can be found in the on-line documentation provided by the Help/Contents 
menu item.

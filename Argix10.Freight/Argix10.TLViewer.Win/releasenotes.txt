INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
TLViewer is installed into a Click-Once deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Argix10\Apps\Freight\TLViewer on a web server like rgxvmweb using 
	Windows explorer. 
2.	Create a sub-folder called Application Files. 
3.	Copy the new versioned Click-Once deployment folder (i.e TLViewer_4_0_0_2) into the Application Files folder; this folder 
	contains the following:
		Argix10.Export.Lib.dll
		Argix10.Windows.Lib.dll
		TLViewer.application
		TLViewer.exe
		TLViewer.exe.config
		TLViewer.exe.manifest
		Infragistics4.Shared.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.UltraWinGrid.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.v12.1.dll
		releasenotes.txt
4.	Copy the deployment manifest, TLViewer.application, into the TLViewer folder. This manifest points to
	tha application manifest (i.e. \TLViewer_4_0_0_2\TLViewer.exe.manifest)
5.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.
6.	Verify http access from Internet Explorer to the following url: 
		http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/Freight/TLViewer/TLViewer.application
7.	The Click-Once deployment is installed on the client machine in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 folder.
8.	Version rollbacks are accomplished by simply copying the deployment manifest (i.e. TLViewer.application) from 
	a previous Click-Once deployment folder (i.e TLViewer_4_0_0_1) into the TLViewer root folder


CONFIGURATION
Open the global database (i.e. RGXSQL400 on jargxvmts), goto the Configuration table, and add/edit the 
values below. Individual users can have overrides from the default values.
	Application     PCName          Key                       Value                     Security 
	--------------- --------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- -------- 
	TLViewer        Default         TraceLevel                4                         1        


NOTES
==============
GENERAL
The TLViewer Application (TLViewer.exe) is a Windows based application that provides information
about trailer load capacities (weight, cube) for a selection of active TLs at a given terminal. It
also provides summary information about trailer loads and load capacities for each agent.


DEPENDENCIES
The Dispatch application is dependent upon the following web services: 
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Freight.Services/TLViewerService.svc
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Membership.Services/RoleService.svc


ROLE MANAGEMENT
The following roles are used in this application:
Warehouse Supervisor
- can do everything.
Shipping Supervisor
- can do everything.
Shipping Clerk
- can do everything.

Use the following link to access the role manager to create and edit role assignments for Argix employees: 
http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/IT/Membership/Membership.application


OPERATION
Normal:
The TLViewer Application (tlviewer.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment 
url (i.e. http://rgxweb/tlviewer/tlviewer.exe). After a brief splash screen , a view of TLs 
for the selected terminal will appear. Additional operating steps can be found in the 
on-line documentation provided by the Help/Contents menu item.

INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
Freight Assignment is installed into a Click-Once deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Argix10\Apps\Freight\FreightAssign on a web server like rgxvmweb using 
	Windows explorer. 
2.	Create a sub-folder called Application Files. 
3.	Copy the new versioned Click-Once deployment folder (i.e FreightAssign_4_0_0_2) into the Application Files folder; this folder 
	contains the following:
		Argix10.Windows.Lib.dll
		FreightAssign.application
		FreightAssign.exe
		FreightAssign.exe.config
		FreightAssign.exe.manifest
		Infragistics4.Shared.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.UltraWinGrid.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.v12.1.dll
		releasenotes.txt
4.	Copy the deployment manifest, FreightAssign.application, into the FreightAssign folder. This manifest points to
	tha application manifest (i.e. \FreightAssign_4_0_0_2\FreightAssign.exe.manifest)
5.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.
6.	Verify http access from Internet Explorer to the following url: 
		http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/Freight/FreightAssign/FreightAssign.application
7.	The Click-Once deployment is installed on the client machine in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 folder.
8.	Version rollbacks are accomplished by simply copying the deployment manifest (i.e. FreightAssign.application) from 
	a previous Click-Once deployment folder (i.e FreightAssign_4_0_0_1) into the FreightAssign root folder


CONFIGURATION
Open the local sort database (i.e. TSORT on jargxvmts), goto the Configuration table, and add/edit the 
values below. Individual users can have overrides from the default values.
	Application               PCName          Key                       Value                     Security

NOTES
==============
GENERAL
The Freight Assignment Application (FreightAssign.exe) is a Windows based application used to 
manage station assignments for sorting direct freight.


DEPENDENCIES
The Dispatch application is dependent upon the following web services: 
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Freight.Services/TsortService.svc
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Membership.Services/RoleService.svc


ROLE MANAGEMENT
The following roles are used in this application:
Tsort Clerk
- can do everything.
Tsort Supervisor
- can do everything.

Use the following link to access the role manager to create and edit role assignments for Argix employees: 
http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/IT/Membership/Membership.application


OPERATION
The Freight Assignment Application (FreightAssign.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment 
url (i.e. http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/Freight/FreightAssign/FreightAssign.application). After a brief splash 
screen, a sizeable window appears and displays inbound freight in an upper grid and station sort assignments 
in a lower grid. The user can assign and unassign these shipments from sort stations in the operating terminal. 
The taskbar displays the operating terminal and sort station. Additional operating steps can be found in the 
on-line documentation provided by the Help/Contents menu item.

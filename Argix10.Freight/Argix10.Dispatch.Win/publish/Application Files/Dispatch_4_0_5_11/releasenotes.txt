INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
Dispatch is installed into a Click-Once deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Argix10\Apps\Freight\Dispatch on a web server like rgxvmweb using 
	Windows explorer. 
2.	Create a sub-folder called Application Files.
3.	Copy the new versioned Click-Once deployment folder (i.e Dispatch_4_0_0_2) into the Application Files folder; this folder 
	contains the following:
		Argix10.Export.Lib.dll
		Argix10.Windows.Lib.dll
		Dispatch.application
		Dispatch.exe
		Dispatch.exe.config
		Dispatch.exe.manifest
		Infragistics2.Shared.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.UltraWinGrid.v10.1.dll
		Infragistics2.Win.v10.1.dll
		releasenotes.txt
4.	Copy the deployment manifest, Dispatch.application, into the Dispatch folder. This manifest points to
	tha application manifest (i.e. \Dispatch_4_0_0_2\Dispatch.exe.manifest)
5.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.
6.	Verify http access from Internet Explorer to the following url: 
		http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/Freight/Dispatch/Dispatch.application
7.	The Click-Once deployment is installed on the client machine in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 folder.
8.	Version rollbacks are accomplished by simply copying the deployment manifest (i.e. Dispatch.application) from 
	a previous Click-Once deployment folder (i.e Dispatch_4_0_0_1) into the Dispatch root folder


CONFIGURATION	
Open the local sort database (i.e. TSORT on rgxsql400), goto the Configuration table, and add/edit the 
values below. Individual users can have overrides from the default values.

NOTES
==============
GENERAL
The Dispatch Application (Dispatch.exe) is a Windows based application used to:
- manage pickup and delivery appointments for inbound freight arriving at the Argix National terminal
- manage freight pickups at the Argix local terminals from client store locations
- manage Argix drivers and Argix contracted drivers allocated to inbounding freight to Argix terminals
- manage Argix drivers and Argix contracted drivers allocated to outbounding freight from the Argix National terminal


DEPENDENCIES
The Dispatch application is dependent upon the following web services: 
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Freight.Services/Dispatch.svc
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Terminals.Services/Roadshow.svc
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Membership.Services/RoleService.svc
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.AgentLineHaul.Services/ShipScheduleService.svc


OPERATION
The Dispatch Application (Dispatch.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment url 
(i.e. http://rgxweb/Argix10/Apps/Freight/Dispatch/Dispatch.application). After a brief splash screen, a sizeable window 
appears that allows interaction with the Client Inbound Sheet, Inbound Schedule, Outbound Schedule, and Pickup Log.
Additional operating steps can be found in the on-line documentation provided by the Help/Contents menu item.

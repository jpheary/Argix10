INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
ISDExport is installed into a Click-Once deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Argix10\Apps\AgentLineHaul\ISDExport on a web server like rgxvmweb using 
	Windows explorer. 
2.	Create a sub-folder called Application Files. 
3.	Copy the new versioned Click-Once deployment folder (i.e ISDExport_4_0_0_2) into the Application Files folder; this folder 
	contains the following:
		Argix10.Windows.Lib.dll
		Infragistics4.Shared.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.UltraWinGrid.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.v12.1.dll
		releasenotes.txt
		ISDExport.application
		ISDExport.exe
		ISDExport.exe.config
		ISDExport.exe.manifest
4.	Copy the deployment manifest, ISDExport.application, into the ISDExport folder. This manifest points to
	tha application manifest (i.e. \ISDExport_4_0_0_2\ISDExport.exe.manifest)
5.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.
6.	Verify http access from Internet Explorer to the following url: 
		http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/AgentLineHaul/ISDExport/ISDExport.application
7.	The Click-Once deployment is installed on the client machine in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 folder.
8.	Version rollbacks are accomplished by simply copying the deployment manifest (i.e. ISDExport.application) from 
	a previous Click-Once deployment folder (i.e ISDExport_4_0_0_1) into the ISDExport root folder


CONFIGURATION
Open the local TSort database, goto the Configuration table, and add/edit the values below:
	Application     PCName          Key                       Value                     Security 
	--------------- --------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- -------- 
	ISD Export      Default         TraceLevel                3                         1        



NOTES
==============
GENERAL
The ISD Export Application (ISDExport.exe) is a Windows based application used to export sorted item 
records into a text file suitable for import into the Bearware RDS system.


DEPENDENCIES
The Dispatch application is dependent upon the following web services: 
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.AgentLineHaul.Services/ISDExportService.svc
- http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Argix10.Membership.Services/RoleService.svc


ROLE MANAGEMENT
The following roles are used in this application:
Tsort Clerk
- can read pickups and sorted items
- can export sorted items
- can read client configuration
Tsort Supervisor
- can do everything Tsort Clerk can do
- can edit client configuration

Use the following link to access the role manager to create and edit role assignments for Argix employees: 
http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/IT/Membership/Membership.application


OPERATION
Normal:
The ISD Export Application (ISDExport.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment url 
(i.e. http://localhost/Argix10/Apps/ISDExport/ISDExport.application). After a brief splash screen, a 
sizeable window appears and displays a split window with a Pickups grid on top and a Sorted Items grid 
on bottom. The Pickups grid shows pickups for the selected day for ISD clients. Select a pickup to 
display the cartons sorted for that pickup in the Sorted Items grid. If there are sorted cartons for 
the selected pickup, use the File/Export menu item to export the sorted items to a text file. The 
taskbar displays the operating terminal and connection status. Additional operating steps can be found 
in the on-line documentation provided by the Help/Contents menu item.

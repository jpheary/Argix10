INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
Ship Schedule is installed into a Click-Once deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Argix10\Apps\AgentLineHaul\ShipSchedule on a web server like rgxvmweb using 
	Windows explorer. 
2.	Create a sub-folder called Application Files. 
3.	Copy the new versioned Click-Once deployment folder (i.e ShipSchedule_4_0_0_2) into the Application Files folder; this folder 
	contains the following:
		Argix10.Export.Lib.dll
		Argix10.Windows.Lib.dll
		ExportDataset.xsd
		Infragistics4.Shared.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.UltraWinGrid.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.v12.1.dll
		Microsoft.ReportingServices.Interfaces.dll
		releasenotes.txt
		ShipSchedule.application
		ShipSchedule.exe
		ShipSchedule.exe.config
		ShipSchedule.exe.manifest
4.	Copy the deployment manifest, ShipSchedule.application, into the ShipSchedule folder. This manifest points to
	tha application manifest (i.e. \ShipSchedule_4_0_0_2\ShipSchedule.exe.manifest)
5.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.
6.	Verify http access from Internet Explorer to the following url: 
		http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/AgentLineHaul/ShipSchedule/ShipSchedule.application
7.	The Click-Once deployment is installed on the client machine in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 folder.
8.	Version rollbacks are accomplished by simply copying the deployment manifest (i.e. ShipSchedule.application) from 
	a previous Click-Once deployment folder (i.e ShipSchedule_4_0_0_1) into the ShipSchedule root folder


CONFIGURATION	
Open the local sort database (i.e. TSORT on jargxvmts), goto the Configuration table, and add/edit the 
values below. Individual users can have overrides from the default values.

OPERATION
Normal:
The Ship Schedule Application (ShipSchedule.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment url 
(i.e. http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/AgentLineHaul/ShipSchedule/ShipSchedule.application). After a brief splash screen, 
a sizeable window appears and displays a split window. The taskbar displays the operating terminal and connection status. 
Additional operating steps can be found in the on-line documentation provided by the Help/Contents menu item.

INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
Ship Schedule Templates is installed into a Click-Once deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Argix10\Apps\AgentLineHaul\ShipScheduleTemplates on a web server like 
rgxvmweb using Windows explorer. 
2.	Create a sub-folder called Application Files.
3.	Copy the new versioned Click-Once deployment folder (i.e ShipScheduleTemplates_4_0_0_2) into the Application Files 
	folder; this folder contains the following:
		Argix10.Export.dll
		Argix10.Windows.dll
		Infragistics4.Shared.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.UltraWinGrid.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.v12.1.dll
		releasenotes.txt
		ShipScheduleTemplates.application
		ShipScheduleTemplates.exe
		ShipScheduleTemplates.exe.config
		ShipScheduleTemplates.exe.manifest
4.	Copy the deployment manifest, ShipScheduleTemplates.application, into the ShipScheduleTemplates folder. This manifest points to
	tha application manifest (i.e. \ShipScheduleTemplates_4_0_0_2\ShipScheduleTemplates.exe.manifest)
5.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.
6.	Verify http access from Internet Explorer to the following url: 
		http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/AgentLineHaul/ShipScheduleTemplates/ShipScheduleTemplates.application
7.	The Click-Once deployment is installed on the client machine in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 folder.
8.	Version rollbacks are accomplished by simply copying the deployment manifest (i.e. ShipScheduleTemplates.application) from 
	a previous Click-Once deployment folder (i.e ShipScheduleTemplates_4_0_0_1) into the ShipScheduleTemplates root folder

NOTES
==============
GENERAL
The Ship Schedule Templates Application (ShipScheduleTemplates.exe) is a Windows based application used 
to manage ship schedule template trips. These templates are used by the Ship Schedule application to add 
pre-defined trips to a ship schedule.

OPERATION
Normal:
The Ship Schedule Templates Application (ShipScheduleTemplates.exe) operates by launching from a web server deployment url 
(i.e. http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/ShipScheduleTemplates/ShipScheduleTemplates.application). After a brief splash screen, 
a sizeable window appears and displays a grid loaded with ship schedule templates for all Argix terminals. The taskbar 
displays the operating terminal and connection status. Additional operating steps can be found in the on-line documentation 
provided by the Help/Contents menu item.

INSTALLATION
==============
DEPLOYMENT
Security Center is installed into a Click-Once deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Argix10\Apps\HR\SecurityCenter on a web server like rgxvmweb using 
	Windows explorer. 
2.	Create a sub-folder called Application Files. 
3.	Copy the new versioned Click-Once deployment folder (i.e SecurityCenter_4_0_0_2) into the Application Files folder; this folder 
	contains the following:
		Argix10.Windows.Lib.dll
		Infragistics4.Shared.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.UltraWinGrid.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.v12.1.dll
		releasenotes.txt
		SecurityCenter.application
		SecurityCenter.exe
		SecurityCenter.exe.config
		SecurityCenter.exe.manifest
4.	Copy the deployment manifest, SecurityCenter.application, into the SecurityCenter folder. This manifest points to
	tha application manifest (i.e. \SecurityCenter_4_0_0_2\SecurityCenter.exe.manifest)
5.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.
6.	Verify http access from Internet Explorer to the following url: 
		http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/HR/SecurityCenter/SecurityCenter.application
7.	The Click-Once deployment is installed on the client machine in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 folder.
8.	Version rollbacks are accomplished by simply copying the deployment manifest (i.e. SecurityCenter.application) from 
	a previous Click-Once deployment folder (i.e SecurityCenter_4_0_0_1) into the SecurityCenter root folder

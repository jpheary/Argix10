DEPLOYMENT
DeliveryPoints is installed into a deployment folder visible from an IIS web service as follows:
1.	Create a virtual folder c:\inetpub\wwwroot\Argix10.DeliveryPoints on a web server using Windows explorer.
2.	Copy the following files into this folder:
		Argix10.Windows.dll
		Infragistics4.Shared.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.UltraWinGrid.v12.1.dll
		Infragistics4.Win.v12.1.dll
		DeliveryPoints.application
		DeliveryPoints.exe
		DeliveryPoints.exe.config
		DeliveryPoints.exe.manifest
		releasenotes.txt
4.	Copy the deployment manifest, DeliveryPoints.application, into the DeliveryPoints folder. This manifest points to
	tha application manifest (i.e. \DeliveryPoints_4_0_0_2\DeliveryPoints.exe.manifest)
5.	Launch the Internet Information Services snap-in and validate that the virtual folder allows
	anonymous access. A web application does not need to be created for deployment.
6.	Verify http access from Internet Explorer to the following url: 
		http://rgxvmweb/Argix10/Apps/Terminals/DeliveryPoints/DeliveryPoints.application
7.	The Click-Once deployment is installed on the client machine in the C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0 folder.
8.	Version rollbacks are accomplished by simply copying the deployment manifest (i.e. DeliveryPoints.application) from 
	a previous Click-Once deployment folder (i.e DeliveryPoints_4_0_0_1) into the DeliveryPoints root folder

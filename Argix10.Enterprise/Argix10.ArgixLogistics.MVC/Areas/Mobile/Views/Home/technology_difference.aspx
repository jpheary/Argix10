        <p class="body-copy">Argix Logistics gives you the advantage of full in-house IT capability. With our proprietary software we have the creative flexibility, customized reporting and visibility you need.<br />
        <br />
        The Argix Logistics software allows for multiple shipments from multiple locations, anywhere along the delivery supply chain, to be consolidated into a single new shipment (on a single new delivery bill). The resulting aggregate invoicing means lower cost with fewer deliveries.<br />
        <br />
        Argix provides a web based tracking system with multiple scan points. We offer our clients the unique ability to use their own carton or shipment ID number in the tracking process. Unlike other carriers who can only give you visibility either at the carton or at the shipment level, Argix provides full visibility at the carton, P.O. number, shipment, date range, trailer and consignee level.<br />
        <br />
        Our propriety Smart Scan technology closes the loop with detailed delivery information. In one scan, the carton is checked against the delivery bill for accuracy, identifying and correcting the shortages, overages and misrouted cartons at the point of delivery. We call this &quot;active scanning&quot; a smarter, more efficient alternative to &quot;blind scanning&quot; where the scanner carries no data and accepts whatever is being scanned.</p>

            <p class="body-copy">To get the final supply chain results you expect, the initial decisions you make are the most 
            critical. Argix Logistics leverages strong global connections to help you carry out these all-important first steps.<br />
            <br />
            At Argix we can manage, negotiate and coordinate the consolidation of your import activities from multiple vendors 
            at multiple ports into container shipments. The result is a seamless flow of product into your domestic operation-the 
            way you need it to be.<br />
            <br />
            We can also introduce carton labeling at origin to begin directional pointers for each carton to its intended final 
            destination.<br />
            <br />
            For every journey there are important first steps- steps that start you in the right direction.</p>

         <div class="content">
            <p class="body-copy">Argix Supply Chain Management understands that an organization's ocean freight requirements are 
            rarely a one-size-fits-all proposition. However, it is often the case that the largest volumes get the most attention. 
            We offer reliable ocean freight services that are designed to fit your import program.<br />
            <br />
            Our team of experienced negotiators will help you secure what you need, when you need it. By consolidating volumes 
            from across the industry, Argix can negotiate on your behalf with NVOs, freight forwarders and the Steam Ship lines 
            directly to create an Ocean Freight program that can improve service at the best rates available.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p class="body-copy">Argix understands that Customs Brokerage is one of the most important
            elements in an importer's supply chain network; a necessary operation that
            most organizations may not have the time or expertise to deal with. To an importer &quot;no news&quot; is the only 
            news you want from a resource that manages your interests with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs 
            and Border Patrol. There is only one rule – Compliance.<br />
            <br />
            Argix connects you with experts in this field familiar with the latest requirements and can help align your product 
            for appropriate classification and documentation that streamlines entry into U.S. Commerce. Strategically allied with 
            only C-TPAT certified partners Argix can assist you in navigating through compliance instruction and certification.</p>
